## Looking in to BTB code project

Could use google's Appsheet.
Gives a secure, remote access, database.

## Listening to some random chiptunes

[Autotracker](https://www.vitling.xyz/toys/autotracker/)

Just found about this.
Using it as some background music.

## Blender

Need to try to see if the Imphenzia palette can work with an anime shader.

If I can get that working.
Need to see how it interacts with a painterly effect.
