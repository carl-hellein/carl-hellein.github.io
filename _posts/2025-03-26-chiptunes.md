## Things

Listing to a bunch of random chip tune music.
It makes good background music.

## What I'm up to

Drilled some larger holes in some doors to install deadbolts this morning.
The keys for the existing locks were lost.
Being older, they had smaller bodies, and thus smaller holes through the door.
The new locks also have protrusions on the exterior side the same size as the hole.
Ended up picking up a neat guide and hole saw kit for drilling lock hardware.

Spent the rest of my day doing random stuff.

Did about an hour on the trainer.
Bailed on the higher effort parts of the program I was following.
